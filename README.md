# Digital IC Design

This repository contains the assignments part of the course EE6133 (Jul-Nov 2023). All schematics and layouts were built with Electric and simulated on LTSpice. The assignments build towards the final project, that is to build a 8-bit carry-save signed multiplier with pipelining.
